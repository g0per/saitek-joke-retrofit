# saitek-joke-retrofit
Retrofit mod for a saitek pro flight joke with a dead board

----

Main purpose of this repo is storing the software and schematics of a full repair on a Saitek/Logitech Pro Flight Joke. Main board was FUBAR, so I'm replacing it with some HID microcontrollers that can reuse the mechanical assemblies and preexisting inputs.

Onboard clock will be replaced by a Raspberry Pi Pico running Micropython.
