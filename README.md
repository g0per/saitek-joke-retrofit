# saitek-joke-retrofit
Retrofit mod for a saitek pro flight joke with a dead board

----

Main purpose of this repo is storing the software and schematics of a full repair on a Saitek/Logitech Pro Flight Joke. Main board was FUBAR, so I'm replacing it with some HID microcontrollers set up under MMJoy_2 that can reuse the mechanical assemblies and preexisting inputs.

Onboard clock will be replaced by a Raspberry Pi Pico running Micropython.
